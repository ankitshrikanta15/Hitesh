// Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language

//ececuation context - one line of code at a time (each execuation waits for the last one to complete before execuation) 

// call stack
//Memory Heap

//Blocking code Vs non-Blocking code
// blocking - block the flow of program - read file sync
// non-blocking - dont block the execuation - read file async

//depends upon use cases which is best.
